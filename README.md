## Overview

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a simple, yet powerful, supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. This project focuses on building a KNN classifier from the ground up to deepen the understanding of its mechanics.

## Dataset

The implementation utilizes the 'Social_Network_Ads.csv' dataset, which contains user information such as Age, Estimated Salary, and Purchased status. This dataset is commonly used for classification problems.

## Repository Structure

- `KNearestNeighbor.py`: Contains the implementation of the KNN algorithm.
- `Knn Classifier.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the KNN classifier with the dataset.
- `Social_Network_Ads.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the classifier.
- `knn_test.py`: Script for testing the KNN implementation.

## Usage

To run the KNN classifier:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mehtahet619/CreatingKnnFromScratch.git
